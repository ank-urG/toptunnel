# Pandas Migration Agent - Summary

## Overview
I've created a comprehensive, modular, and robust Pandas Migration Agent for OpenHands that automates the migration of Python codebases from pandas 0.19.2 to 1.1.5.

## Key Components Created

### 1. **Core Agent** (`agent.py`)
- Main agent class `EnhancedPandasMigrationAgent` 
- Manages the complete migration workflow
- Handles state management and orchestration
- Integrates with OpenHands agent framework

### 2. **Migration Rules Engine** (`migration_rules.py`)
- Defines migration rules with priorities (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Handles pattern-based replacements
- Supports AST-based transformations for complex cases
- Extensible with custom rules

### 3. **Test Runner** (`test_runner.py`)
- Uses existing conda environments (py36-1.1.10 for pandas 0.19.2, pandas_115_final for pandas 1.1.5)
- Supports multiple test frameworks (pytest, unittest, nose)
- Runs tests before and after migration using `conda run`
- Compares results to identify regressions

### 4. **Compatibility Checker** (`compatibility_checker.py`)
- Analyzes code for compatibility issues
- Uses both regex and AST analysis
- Categorizes issues by severity
- Provides actionable suggestions

### 5. **Report Generator** (`report_generator.py`)
- Generates comprehensive migration reports
- Multiple output formats (Markdown, HTML, JSON)
- Includes executive summary, detailed changes, test results
- Provides recommendations

### 6. **Utilities** (`utils.py`)
- File discovery and backup functions
- Import extraction and analysis
- Test output parsing
- Syntax validation

### 7. **Documentation**
- Comprehensive README with usage examples
- Configuration file with default settings
- Example usage scripts
- Test suite for validation

## Key Features

### Migration Capabilities
- **Automated Detection**: Finds all Python files and identifies deprecated features
- **Smart Replacements**: 
  - `pd.Panel` → `aqr.core.panel.Panel`
  - `pd.ols` → `aqr.stats.ols.OLS`
  - `.ix` → `.loc/.iloc`
  - `.sort()` → `.sort_values()`
  - Rolling functions → `.rolling().method()`
  - And many more...

### Safety Features
- **Automatic Backups**: Creates timestamped backups before modifications
- **Syntax Validation**: Ensures code remains valid after migration
- **Test Verification**: Runs tests in both environments
- **Rollback Support**: Can restore files if migration fails

### Customization Options
- **Custom Import Mappings**: Define your own replacement modules
- **Custom Migration Rules**: Add company-specific patterns
- **Configurable Behavior**: Control testing, backups, rollback behavior
- **Flexible Test Commands**: Support for custom test execution

## Usage in OpenHands

### Configuration
Add to your `config.toml`:
```toml
custom_agents_enabled = true
custom_agents_path = "/path/to/openhands/custom_agents"

[[agents.custom]]
name = "PandasMigrationAgent"
module_path = "pandas_migration_agent.agent"
class_name = "EnhancedPandasMigrationAgent"
display_name = "Pandas Migration Agent (0.19 → 1.1.5)"
```

### Running the Agent
```bash
# Start OpenHands with the migration agent
openhands --agent PandasMigrationAgent

# In the chat:
"Migrate the repository at /workspace/my-project from pandas 0.19.2 to 1.1.5"
```

## Migration Workflow

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Scans repository for Python files
   - Identifies pandas usage patterns
   - Detects deprecated features

2. **Pre-Migration Testing**
   - Creates pandas 0.19.2 environment
   - Runs all tests to establish baseline
   - Records results for comparison

3. **Migration Phase**
   - Applies migration rules in priority order
   - Creates backups of all modified files
   - Validates syntax after each change

4. **Post-Migration Testing**
   - Creates pandas 1.1.5 environment
   - Runs tests again
   - Identifies any regressions

5. **Report Generation**
   - Creates detailed migration report
   - Lists all changes made
   - Highlights test regressions
   - Provides recommendations

## Report Output

The agent generates a comprehensive report including:
- Executive summary with success/failure statistics
- Detailed list of all file changes
- Test results comparison (before vs after)
- Compatibility analysis
- Actionable recommendations
- Migration configuration used

## Architecture Benefits

- **Modular Design**: Each component is independent and testable
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new migration rules or features
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and detailed error reporting
- **Production Ready**: Includes logging, validation, and safety checks
- **Well Documented**: Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Testing

The agent includes:
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration test examples
- Validation scripts
- Example usage patterns

## Next Steps

To use this agent:
1. Copy the `custom_agents/pandas_migration_agent` folder to your OpenHands installation
2. Update your OpenHands configuration
3. Run the agent on your repositories
4. Review the generated reports
5. Address any test regressions or compatibility issues

The agent is designed to handle real-world codebases with multiple microservices, ensuring backward compatibility throughout the migration process.
