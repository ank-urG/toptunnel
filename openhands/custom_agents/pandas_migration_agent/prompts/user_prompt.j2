I need to migrate the following code from pandas 0.19.2 to pandas 1.1.5 while maintaining backward compatibility.

{% if file_path %}
File: {{ file_path }}
{% endif %}

{% if code_snippet %}
Code to migrate:
```python
{{ code_snippet }}
```
{% endif %}

Please:
1. First test the current code in both pandas environments to identify any compatibility issues
2. Apply only the necessary backward-compatible changes based on the migration rules
3. Test the migrated code in both environments to ensure it works correctly
4. Report the results including:
   - What changes were made and why
   - Test results in both environments
   - Any issues encountered and how they were resolved

{% if specific_issues %}
Known issues to address:
{{ specific_issues }}
{% endif %}

Remember:
- DO NOT change code that already works in both versions
- ALWAYS test before and after changes
- If tests fail, revert and try a different approach
- Check for AQR library dependencies in C:\Workspace
