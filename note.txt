I have our codebase running in python-3.6 with pandas-0.19.2 there are multiple  │
│   microservices, now I want to upgrade pandas version-1.1.5 but due to few         │
│   removed features like pd.Panel and pd.OLS etc\                                   │
│   \                                                                                │
│   So i have created a Panel class in aqr.core.panel.py module which can be         │
│   directly imported similiarly OLS class in aqr.stats.ols.py these module can be   │
│   imported anywhere as it is and they behave the same as pandas one used to be,    │
│   some other changes removed like valid(), sort(), pd.rolling_func() and other     │
│   deprecated or removed things like ix etc\                                        │
│   \                                                                                │
│    in my machine with some name   

     I want to create an agent in openhands folder so      │
│   that it can migrate all the repos one by one for which I give him the task run   │
│   all the unit tests and it tests and make sure every changes is backward          │
│   compatible. Backward compatibility is the most importtant things, I have few     │
│   other list of changes which could be replaced as backward compatible changes,    │
│   After migrating the repo, it should create a final report like what were the     │
│   failures, what fix was made, list of file changes, categorised list of unit      │
│   tests and it tests with success or failure mark and all these thing should only  │
│   be run in two pandas-0.19 and pandas-1.1.5 runtime no other versions of any of   │
│   this and all the packages version can be found in the runtimes itself, don't     │
│   assume any version by itself. \                                                  │
│   Can you create that agent for me, well modular and customizable and robust       │
│   agent with all the features a developer could do                                 │
